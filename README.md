The project is based on the API from The Wall Street Journal. API access is paid and data can be obtained for free only on the local host. In this regard (for publish the application), I used the API-based mock data from The Wall Street Journal. You can switch from a mock API to a real API in the store, in the getNewsList function in stores -> mainStore.js.
